# Molecular Structure and Function of Glycans and Glycoproteins in the Biology of Health and Disease

In our research group we use high-performance computing (HPC) molecular simulation techniques to reconstruct complex carbohydrates (glycans) and to understand their many different roles in biology. During the past few years we have dedicated a huge amount of our time and computational resources to the creation of the GlycoShape DB, where we are continuously depositing equilibrium 3D structures of glycans, glycan fragments and epitopes, from all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, that can be used in combination with molecular docking and/or MD to study glycan recognition and with Re-Glyco to rebuild glycoproteins to their native functional state. In addition to the development of GlycoShape to advance research in structural glycobiology, we are actively working in the following research areas:

## Current research topics include,

*   Viral glycobiology
*   Glycans recognition in bacterial infection
*   Glycan recognition in immune response
*   Glycosylation in adhesion-GPCRs
*   OST regulation of protein N-glycosylation
*   Hierarchy and control in N-glycosylation pathways
*   Development of statistical and ML tools for advancing glycomics and glycoanalytics
