# Erythropoietin (EPO)

Erythropoietin, also known as erythropoetin, haematopoietin, or haemopoietin, is a  glycoprotein cytokine secreted mainly by the kidneys in response to  cellular hypoxia; it stimulates red blood cell production in the bone  marrow.

*Lance Armstrong, the seven-time Tour de France winner, was at the center of one of cycling's biggest doping scandals involving EPO. Armstrong systematically used EPO to boost his red blood cell count and enhance oxygen delivery to his muscles, giving him a significant competitive advantage. His eventual admission to EPO use led to the stripping of all his Tour de France titles and a lifetime ban from competitive cycling.*
